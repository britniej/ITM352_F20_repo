# hello-world
A place to start this new adventure in programming.

Hello everyone,
My name is Britnie Jane Roach and I hope to be a double major in MIS and MGT after this semester!
I enjoy cooking, hiking, the beach, and way too much time at home.
I have lived in California, Wyoming, England, The Netherlands, and now Hawaii for the past 6 years.
