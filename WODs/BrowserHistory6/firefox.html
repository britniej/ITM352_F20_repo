        <p>The project which became <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&rct=j&q=&esrc=s&source=web&cd=&cad=rja&uact=8&ved=2ahUKEwj09-v7_OTrAhWyHjQIHSE1AgkQFjAAegQIAxAC&url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.mozilla.org%2Fen-US%2Ffirefox%2F&usg=AOvVaw1aIQZ3syQXuPwS0XmIL8lb">Firefox</a>  started as an experimental branch of the Mozilla Suite called m/b (or mozilla/browser). After it had been sufficiently developed, binaries for public testing appeared in September 2002 under the name Phoenix.</p>
        <p>Firefox 23 was released on August 6, 2013. It includes an updated Firefox logo, mixed content blocking enabled by default to defend against man-in-the-middle attacks, implementation of the range form control attribute in HTML5, dropping support for the blink HTML element as well as text-decoration:blink CSS element, the restriction to have to “switch to a different search provider across the entire browser,” and a global browser console, a new network monitor among other things.</p></div>
